# Cold tolerance in *Caenorhabditis elegans*

## Overview
Rmarkdown scripts and rendered output for data anlaysis and visualisation of cold tolerance in seven *C. elegans* strains. 

## Scripts 
- **easyXpress_12hrscold.Rmd**: easyXpress script used to process image data to get animal lengths for 12-hour cold treatment assay. 
- **easyXpress_24hrscold.Rmd**: easyXpress script used to process image data to get animal lengths for 24-hour cold treatment assay.
- **micropub_visualizations.Rmd**: summarises data for each both cold treatments, runs ANOVAs and likelihood ratio tests, calculates broad sense heritabilities, and data visualization.
